## Essential Skills for SharePoint Administrators and Developers
Microsoft SharePoint centralizes document storage and collaboration to help companies organize, manage, and share documents. Today, it’s one of the top business collaboration platforms, as two out of three enterprise employees use SharePoint.

As more businesses migrate to SharePoint (Microsoft claims that it's adding 20,000 users every day), the demand for experienced SharePoint administrators and developers will increase. Companies need to ensure their IT teams have the skills to manage and customize the highly technical SharePoint platform.

SharePoint helps businesses work faster and more collaboratively; however, it’s a complex platform that requires knowledge in a variety of areas. Below are some of the most essential SharePoint Administrator and Developer skills that will help professionals and their organizations effectively implement SharePoint solutions.

### SharePoint Administrator Skills
A SharePoint Administrator is the first line of support, administration, user education, and security. They are responsible for day-to-day management, understanding the site’s purpose, and delegating tasks to other SharePoint employees to resolve issues quickly. They also understand some SharePoint architecture.

SharePoint Administrators manage the content hosted on SharePoint and help expedite user adoption within an organization. They are responsible for maintaining and securing the platform and monitoring system usage to optimize performance. Other basic tasks include:

1. Creating and configuring new sites
2. Adding document libraries
3. Creating and configuring lists and forms
4. Backing up SharePoint sites

###Core Microsoft Skills for SharePoint Administrators
SharePoint integrates with several core Microsoft products, so Administrators should be familiar with at least the following:

**SQL Server:** Almost all SharePoint data is stored here, so you will want to know how to interact with it
**Power BI:** This tool can help centralize data, simplify it with queries, and share it in highly visual reports
**PowerShell:** There are times where you are performing repetitive tasks that can be scripted using PowerShell
**Office 365:** Office 365 is set of online apps/services that encompasses email, calendaring, file sharing, video, collaboration tools, and more
### Technical Skills for SharePoint Administrators
Companies use SharePoint to manage and store documents across the organization. SharePoint Administrators also need a combination of business and technical knowledge to resolve potential roadblocks and user issues. This knowledge includes:

1. Windows operating system and hardware
2. Software management
3. Networking infrastructure services, including encryption, security zones, and firewalls
4. Business Analysis skills to organize and execute SharePoint projects that align with the business workflow
5. Basic SharePoint tools like ULS Logs, workflows to automate business processes, and SharePoint forms for tasks, such as creating expense reports
## SharePoint Developer Skills
While SharePoint offers “out-of-the-box” features, many companies customize the platform for their needs. SharePoint Developers create custom code and applications. Developers have in-depth knowledge of programming languages and technologies that work with SharePoint and create, implement, and troubleshoot new applications and integrations. Although the lines between an Administrator and Developer often blur, developers possess advanced SharePoint skills to code custom applications and websites to meet specific business needs.

The best SharePoint developers have a knack for understanding end-user problems and discovering the right solutions. They understand how users access and organize information in SharePoint and implement processes that streamline and simplify information management and collaboration.

Core Microsoft Skills for SharePoint Developers
As a SharePoint Developer, you’ll be responsible for creating and customizing SharePoint websites. Seek out experience with these core programs to elevate to a Developer role:

**SharePoint Designer:** This user-friendly tool is perfect for quick building integration solutions or simple workflows.
**Visio:** This program is useful for drafting and collaborating on workflows before exporting them to SharePoint Designer.
**PowerShell:** This tool allows you to run and automate scripts in SharePoint.
**Visual Studio:** Visual Studio provides project templates for SharePoint sites and helps bring complex site requirements to life.

### Q1. How do we decide whether we need go for SharePoint or not?
Ans:
When it comes to choosing between SharePoint and another web-based platform, it becomes a tough call to decide to choose SharePoint. Let me simplify the choice.

Every organization has its own reason to choose SharePoint. Here I am describing if I have to make a choice then why I will choose SharePoint.

Due to following reasons, I will choose SharePoint because:

SharePoint has better Document Management facilities.
It has better user and rights management
Opens a full scope to customize the application
Provides the best way to collaborate with your team using team sites, tasks management, issue tracking, announcements etc.
Fastest search service
Versioning of the documents and content approvals
Its default workflows
Control over contents

### Q2: Sharepoint types 
1. SharePoint foundation
2. SharePoint Server
3. Office 365 (SharePoint online)

The first two options are SharePoint on-premise, while Office 365 has emerged as a third, fully cloud-hosted model for SharePoint.

### SharePoint Server
SharePoint Server offers a wealth of features that extend upon those offered in SharePoint Foundation. It provide a richer, more advanced collection of features that you can utilize in your organization’s solutions.

##### Key Features of SharePoint Server
Some of these additional features are described in the following list −

**Advanced Search** − The search features and functionality features available within the Server versions offer more flexibility. They allow customized Search Results pages that you can configure with customized search Web Parts.

**Web Content Management** − SharePoint Server supports web content creation and publishing for the internet.

**Enterprise Services** − These services provide ways for you to build custom solutions quickly and easily using tools that are available to you within the Office product family.

**Business Connectivity Services** − Business Connectivity Services (BCS) enables you to connect to these external data sources and display business data via Web Parts, user profiles, or SharePoint lists.

**Social Networking and Computing** − Social networking is everywhere and has become an expected feature set of many solutions.

**Records management** − SharePoint Server provides excellent support for the management of content throughout its entire life cycle.

### Office 365
Office 365 has emerged as a third, fully cloud-hosted model for SharePoint. It is the alternate option to hosting your own farm in your own on-premises Data Center.

##### Key Features of Office 365
The options for licensing SharePoint Online through Office 365 are based on factors such as the number of users you want to add, the amount of data you need to store, and the features you need to be available.

It has also become a great place where you can develop rich applications (both as SharePoint-hosted and cloud-hosted apps) and scale without the cost of managing the on-premises infrastructure.

It does not have all the same services and features as SharePoint Server, but does carry with it some great development capabilities.

There are .NET applications that you build using C# or Visual Basic and then deploy into SharePoint as .WSPs or .APPs. There are lighter-weight apps such as HTML5 and JavaScript apps that you can also deploy.

As a developer, you have the capability to customize any of the SharePoint editions, whether it is SharePoint Foundation, Server, or Office 365.

### Q1: What is share point site collection and site?

SharePoint Site Collection, is a collection of SharePoint Sites. Each site collection contains a single top-level site and subsites below it.

SharePoint Site is a website that contains different SharePoint Web Parts like Document Library, Calendar, Task List, etc. SharePoint sites can have 1 or more pages to display content to the user.

### Q2: WHEN TO CREATE A SITE IN SHAREPOINT?
You are looking to create a site that needs to rely on same metadata, security or navigation as the existing sites you already have.
You are a small organization. Unless you want to administer SharePoint on a full-time basis, just stay with 1 site collection.
You created a template site (i.e. Project site template or department site template) and want your new site to resemble same look and feel as the rest of the sites. Site templates can only be replicated across same site collection
You only plan to have a handful of SharePoint sites in your organization. If you plan to roll out hundreds and hundreds of sites, you might take a look at reasons below.

### Q3: WHEN TO CREATE A SITE COLLECTION IN SHAREPOINT?
You are a large organization with multiple business units and each business unit has independent and separate business functions.
You are a large organization and each of your departments has a large number of people and each department is expected to create lots and lots of sites that do not to rely on global metadata or security groups.
You are a large organization and want to separate your SharePoint administrative functions (have separate SharePoint administrators for each site collection)
Your organization has lots of content (I am talking about hundreds of GB). You can allocate both server resources and storage per site collection. So if you say have a number of sites that are running server-intensive workflows or you have lots of content, you can allocate separate site collections and assign those accordingly.

### Q4: What is the difference between the Site and Page?

### Q5: What is a list in SharePoint?
A SharePoint list is a container for information, similar to a very simple database or spreadsheet. Using a list is the most common way to manage information in a SharePoint site.

### Q6: What is SharePoint Framework?
The SharePoint Framework (SPFx) is a page and web part model that provides full support for client-side SharePoint development, easy integration with SharePoint data, and support for open source tooling. With the SharePoint Framework, you can use modern web technologies and tools in your preferred development environment to build productive experiences and apps that are responsive and mobile-ready from day one. The SharePoint Framework works for SharePoint Online and also for on-premises (SharePoint 2016 Feature Pack 2 and SharePoint 2019).

Key features of the SharePoint Framework include the following:
It runs in the context of the current user and connection in the browser. There are no iFrames for the customization (JavaScript is embedded directly to the page).
The controls are rendered in the normal page DOM.
The controls are responsive and accessible by nature.
It enables the developer to access the lifecycle in addition to render, load, serialize and deserialize, configuration changes, and more.
It is framework-agnostic. You can use any JavaScript framework that you like: React, Handlebars, Knockout, Angular, and more.
The toolchain is based on common open source client development tools such as npm, TypeScript, Yeoman, webpack, and gulp.
Performance is reliable.
End users can use SPFx client-side solutions that are approved by the tenant administrators (or their delegates) on all sites, including self-service team, group, or personal sites.
SPFx web parts can be added to both classic and modern pages.

### Q7: Why the SharePoint Framework?
That architecture worked well in environments with only one enterprise, but it didn’t scale to the cloud, where multiple tenants run side-by-side. As a result, we introduced two alternative models: client-side JavaScript injection, and SharePoint Add-ins. Both of these solutions have pros and cons.

JavaScript injection
One of the most popular web parts in SharePoint Online is the Script Editor. You can paste JavaScript into the Script Editor web part and have that JavaScript execute when the page renders. It’s simple and rudimentary, but effective. It runs in the same browser context as the page, and is in the same DOM, so it can interact with other controls on the page. It is also relatively performant, and simple to use.

There are a few downsides to this approach, however. First, while you can package your solution so that end users can drop the control onto the page, you can't easily provide configuration options. Also, the end user can edit the page and modify the script, which can break the web part. Another big problem is that the Script Editor web part is not marked as "Safe For Scripting". Most self-service site collections (my-sites, team sites, group sites) have a feature known as "NoScript" enabled. Technically, it is the removal of the Add/Customize Pages (ACP) permission in SharePoint. This means that the Script Editor web part will be blocked from executing on these sites.

SharePoint Add-in model
The current option for solutions that run in NoScript sites is the add-in/app-part model. This implementation creates an iFrame where the actual experience resides and executes. The advantage is that because it's external to the system and has no access to the current DOM/connection, it's easier for information workers to trust and deploy. End users can install add-ins on NoScript sites.

There are some downsides to this approach as well. First, they run in an iFrame. iFrames are slower than the Script Editor web part, because it requires a new request to another page. The page has to go through authentication and authorization, make its own calls to get SharePoint data, load various JavaScript libraries, and more. A Script Editor web part might typically take, for example, 100 milliseconds to load and render, while an app part might take 2 seconds or more. Additionally, the iFrame boundary makes it more difficult to create responsive designs and inherit CSS and theming information. iFrames do have stronger security, which can be useful for you (your page is inaccessible by other controls on the page) and for the end user (the control has no access to their connection to Office 365).

### Q7: Script Editor Web parts vs App Parts vs SPFx Web parts

**SPFx Webparts**

Client-side web parts
Leverages modern JavaScript frameworks
Can be used on classic SharePoint pages
Provides modern experience
Responsiveness and out of the box
Free, open source tool 

**Script Editor Web Parts**

Choice of developers for customizing DOM on classic SharePoint sites
Script can be easily edited by any user
Cannot be added to “NoScript” sites

**App Parts**

Developed using Add-on model
Uses iFrame
Cannot access DOM of SharePoint page
Development and deployment is a bit complicated

## Essential Skills for SharePoint Administrators and Developers
Microsoft SharePoint centralizes document storage and collaboration to help companies organize, manage, and share documents. Today, it’s one of the top business collaboration platforms, as two out of three enterprise employees use SharePoint.

As more businesses migrate to SharePoint (Microsoft claims that it's adding 20,000 users every day), the demand for experienced SharePoint administrators and developers will increase. Companies need to ensure their IT teams have the skills to manage and customize the highly technical SharePoint platform.

SharePoint helps businesses work faster and more collaboratively; however, it’s a complex platform that requires knowledge in a variety of areas. Below are some of the most essential SharePoint Administrator and Developer skills that will help professionals and their organizations effectively implement SharePoint solutions.

### SharePoint Administrator Skills
A SharePoint Administrator is the first line of support, administration, user education, and security. They are responsible for day-to-day management, understanding the site’s purpose, and delegating tasks to other SharePoint employees to resolve issues quickly. They also understand some SharePoint architecture.

SharePoint Administrators manage the content hosted on SharePoint and help expedite user adoption within an organization. They are responsible for maintaining and securing the platform and monitoring system usage to optimize performance. Other basic tasks include:

1. Creating and configuring new sites
2. Adding document libraries
3. Creating and configuring lists and forms
4. Backing up SharePoint sites

###Core Microsoft Skills for SharePoint Administrators
SharePoint integrates with several core Microsoft products, so Administrators should be familiar with at least the following:

**SQL Server:** Almost all SharePoint data is stored here, so you will want to know how to interact with it
**Power BI:** This tool can help centralize data, simplify it with queries, and share it in highly visual reports
**PowerShell:** There are times where you are performing repetitive tasks that can be scripted using PowerShell
**Office 365:** Office 365 is set of online apps/services that encompasses email, calendaring, file sharing, video, collaboration tools, and more
### Technical Skills for SharePoint Administrators
Companies use SharePoint to manage and store documents across the organization. SharePoint Administrators also need a combination of business and technical knowledge to resolve potential roadblocks and user issues. This knowledge includes:

1. Windows operating system and hardware
2. Software management
3. Networking infrastructure services, including encryption, security zones, and firewalls
4. Business Analysis skills to organize and execute SharePoint projects that align with the business workflow
5. Basic SharePoint tools like ULS Logs, workflows to automate business processes, and SharePoint forms for tasks, such as creating expense reports
## SharePoint Developer Skills
While SharePoint offers “out-of-the-box” features, many companies customize the platform for their needs. SharePoint Developers create custom code and applications. Developers have in-depth knowledge of programming languages and technologies that work with SharePoint and create, implement, and troubleshoot new applications and integrations. Although the lines between an Administrator and Developer often blur, developers possess advanced SharePoint skills to code custom applications and websites to meet specific business needs.

The best SharePoint developers have a knack for understanding end-user problems and discovering the right solutions. They understand how users access and organize information in SharePoint and implement processes that streamline and simplify information management and collaboration.

Core Microsoft Skills for SharePoint Developers
As a SharePoint Developer, you’ll be responsible for creating and customizing SharePoint websites. Seek out experience with these core programs to elevate to a Developer role:

**SharePoint Designer:** This user-friendly tool is perfect for quick building integration solutions or simple workflows.
**Visio:** This program is useful for drafting and collaborating on workflows before exporting them to SharePoint Designer.
**PowerShell:** This tool allows you to run and automate scripts in SharePoint.
**Visual Studio:** Visual Studio provides project templates for SharePoint sites and helps bring complex site requirements to life.

### Q1. How do we decide whether we need go for SharePoint or not?
Ans:
When it comes to choosing between SharePoint and another web-based platform, it becomes a tough call to decide to choose SharePoint. Let me simplify the choice.

Every organization has its own reason to choose SharePoint. Here I am describing if I have to make a choice then why I will choose SharePoint.

Due to following reasons, I will choose SharePoint because:

SharePoint has better Document Management facilities.
It has better user and rights management
Opens a full scope to customize the application
Provides the best way to collaborate with your team using team sites, tasks management, issue tracking, announcements etc.
Fastest search service
Versioning of the documents and content approvals
Its default workflows
Control over contents

### Q2: Sharepoint types 
1. SharePoint foundation
2. SharePoint Server
3. Office 365 (SharePoint online)

The first two options are SharePoint on-premise, while Office 365 has emerged as a third, fully cloud-hosted model for SharePoint.

### SharePoint Server
SharePoint Server offers a wealth of features that extend upon those offered in SharePoint Foundation. It provide a richer, more advanced collection of features that you can utilize in your organization’s solutions.

##### Key Features of SharePoint Server
Some of these additional features are described in the following list −

**Advanced Search** − The search features and functionality features available within the Server versions offer more flexibility. They allow customized Search Results pages that you can configure with customized search Web Parts.

**Web Content Management** − SharePoint Server supports web content creation and publishing for the internet.

**Enterprise Services** − These services provide ways for you to build custom solutions quickly and easily using tools that are available to you within the Office product family.

**Business Connectivity Services** − Business Connectivity Services (BCS) enables you to connect to these external data sources and display business data via Web Parts, user profiles, or SharePoint lists.

**Social Networking and Computing** − Social networking is everywhere and has become an expected feature set of many solutions.

**Records management** − SharePoint Server provides excellent support for the management of content throughout its entire life cycle.

### Office 365
Office 365 has emerged as a third, fully cloud-hosted model for SharePoint. It is the alternate option to hosting your own farm in your own on-premises Data Center.

##### Key Features of Office 365
The options for licensing SharePoint Online through Office 365 are based on factors such as the number of users you want to add, the amount of data you need to store, and the features you need to be available.

It has also become a great place where you can develop rich applications (both as SharePoint-hosted and cloud-hosted apps) and scale without the cost of managing the on-premises infrastructure.

It does not have all the same services and features as SharePoint Server, but does carry with it some great development capabilities.

There are .NET applications that you build using C# or Visual Basic and then deploy into SharePoint as .WSPs or .APPs. There are lighter-weight apps such as HTML5 and JavaScript apps that you can also deploy.

As a developer, you have the capability to customize any of the SharePoint editions, whether it is SharePoint Foundation, Server, or Office 365.

### Q3: What is share point site collection and site?

SharePoint Site Collection, is a collection of SharePoint Sites. Each site collection contains a single top-level site and subsites below it.

SharePoint Site is a website that contains different SharePoint Web Parts like Document Library, Calendar, Task List, etc. SharePoint sites can have 1 or more pages to display content to the user.

### Q4: WHEN TO CREATE A SITE IN SHAREPOINT?
You are looking to create a site that needs to rely on same metadata, security or navigation as the existing sites you already have.
You are a small organization. Unless you want to administer SharePoint on a full-time basis, just stay with 1 site collection.
You created a template site (i.e. Project site template or department site template) and want your new site to resemble same look and feel as the rest of the sites. Site templates can only be replicated across same site collection
You only plan to have a handful of SharePoint sites in your organization. If you plan to roll out hundreds and hundreds of sites, you might take a look at reasons below.

### Q5: WHEN TO CREATE A SITE COLLECTION IN SHAREPOINT?
You are a large organization with multiple business units and each business unit has independent and separate business functions.
You are a large organization and each of your departments has a large number of people and each department is expected to create lots and lots of sites that do not to rely on global metadata or security groups.
You are a large organization and want to separate your SharePoint administrative functions (have separate SharePoint administrators for each site collection)
Your organization has lots of content (I am talking about hundreds of GB). You can allocate both server resources and storage per site collection. So if you say have a number of sites that are running server-intensive workflows or you have lots of content, you can allocate separate site collections and assign those accordingly.

### Q6: What is the difference between the Site and Page?

### Q7: What is a list in SharePoint?
A SharePoint list is a container for information, similar to a very simple database or spreadsheet. Using a list is the most common way to manage information in a SharePoint site.

### Q8: What is SharePoint Framework?
The SharePoint Framework (SPFx) is a page and web part model that provides full support for client-side SharePoint development, easy integration with SharePoint data, and support for open source tooling. With the SharePoint Framework, you can use modern web technologies and tools in your preferred development environment to build productive experiences and apps that are responsive and mobile-ready from day one. The SharePoint Framework works for SharePoint Online and also for on-premises (SharePoint 2016 Feature Pack 2 and SharePoint 2019).

Key features of the SharePoint Framework include the following:
It runs in the context of the current user and connection in the browser. There are no iFrames for the customization (JavaScript is embedded directly to the page).
The controls are rendered in the normal page DOM.
The controls are responsive and accessible by nature.
It enables the developer to access the lifecycle in addition to render, load, serialize and deserialize, configuration changes, and more.
It is framework-agnostic. You can use any JavaScript framework that you like: React, Handlebars, Knockout, Angular, and more.
The toolchain is based on common open source client development tools such as npm, TypeScript, Yeoman, webpack, and gulp.
Performance is reliable.
End users can use SPFx client-side solutions that are approved by the tenant administrators (or their delegates) on all sites, including self-service team, group, or personal sites.
SPFx web parts can be added to both classic and modern pages.

### Q9: Why the SharePoint Framework?
That architecture worked well in environments with only one enterprise, but it didn’t scale to the cloud, where multiple tenants run side-by-side. As a result, we introduced two alternative models: client-side JavaScript injection, and SharePoint Add-ins. Both of these solutions have pros and cons.

JavaScript injection
One of the most popular web parts in SharePoint Online is the Script Editor. You can paste JavaScript into the Script Editor web part and have that JavaScript execute when the page renders. It’s simple and rudimentary, but effective. It runs in the same browser context as the page, and is in the same DOM, so it can interact with other controls on the page. It is also relatively performant, and simple to use.

There are a few downsides to this approach, however. First, while you can package your solution so that end users can drop the control onto the page, you can't easily provide configuration options. Also, the end user can edit the page and modify the script, which can break the web part. Another big problem is that the Script Editor web part is not marked as "Safe For Scripting". Most self-service site collections (my-sites, team sites, group sites) have a feature known as "NoScript" enabled. Technically, it is the removal of the Add/Customize Pages (ACP) permission in SharePoint. This means that the Script Editor web part will be blocked from executing on these sites.

SharePoint Add-in model
The current option for solutions that run in NoScript sites is the add-in/app-part model. This implementation creates an iFrame where the actual experience resides and executes. The advantage is that because it's external to the system and has no access to the current DOM/connection, it's easier for information workers to trust and deploy. End users can install add-ins on NoScript sites.

There are some downsides to this approach as well. First, they run in an iFrame. iFrames are slower than the Script Editor web part, because it requires a new request to another page. The page has to go through authentication and authorization, make its own calls to get SharePoint data, load various JavaScript libraries, and more. A Script Editor web part might typically take, for example, 100 milliseconds to load and render, while an app part might take 2 seconds or more. Additionally, the iFrame boundary makes it more difficult to create responsive designs and inherit CSS and theming information. iFrames do have stronger security, which can be useful for you (your page is inaccessible by other controls on the page) and for the end user (the control has no access to their connection to Office 365).

### Q10: Script Editor Web parts vs App Parts vs SPFx Web parts

**SPFx Webparts**

Client-side web parts
Leverages modern JavaScript frameworks
Can be used on classic SharePoint pages
Provides modern experience
Responsiveness and out of the box
Free, open source tool 

**Script Editor Web Parts**

Choice of developers for customizing DOM on classic SharePoint sites
Script can be easily edited by any user
Cannot be added to “NoScript” sites

**App Parts**

Developed using Add-on model
Uses iFrame
Cannot access DOM of SharePoint page
Development and deployment is a bit complicated

https://www.voitanos.io/pages/ec-spfxdev-day-3-of-10-how-the-sharepoint-framework-differs-from-traditional-development-and-deployment
**SharePoint Framework customizations execute within the client. They are script-based, not compiled and thus they run in the context of the current page. This is also the only way to customize SharePoint’s modern pages in a supported way.**

Customizations deployed for use with the SharePoint Framework are uploaded to the tenant’s app catalog site making the customizations available across any site within the tenant.

### Q11: Share Point Framework vs Farm solutions vs sandboxed solution
Ans:
**Share Point Framework**
1. Client side execution Model
2. Rendered and executed in page context
3. only way to customize the modern pages
4. Open source cross platform tooling
5. Support first an dthird party development
6. Responsive, acceessible and mobile friendly
7. Scoped to tenant or site
8. Limited to created client side webparts and UI extensions

**Farm Solutions**
Server side execution model
Full server side API
Only supported in on-site environments
Built with Visual studio on windows
Scoped to farm
Build webparts, timer jobs, event receivers, feature receivers, etc

**Sandbox Solutions**
Server-side execution model
Declarative solutions only availble in shareoint online
Built with visual studio in windows
Scoped to site collection
Build features and declarative solutions

**Sharepoint Addon**
Client side or server side execution
client-side API
Execution context externalized from share point
Build with Visual studio on windows
scoped to tenent and site
Build web parts, remote event receivers and work flows and more

**JavaScript Injection**
Client-sde injection model
Client-side API
Build/Implement with any build toolchain
Scoped to SharePoint page
Implemented manually; no automated deployment

After solutions came SharePoint Add-ins, initially called apps. Man the reason why they were renamed from apps to add-ins is an interesting one, but that’s for another time.

### Q12: Share Point Addins
These are available in two flavors, the SharePoint Hosted Add-in and the Provider Hosted Add-in.

For SharePoint Hosted Add-ins, they run exclusively within a client-side context. Any custom business logic has to be implemented using JavaScript as the files deployed to SharePoint while stored in SharePoint, are not run on the server. They are rendered in the client and run there.

In the case of Provider Hosted Add-ins, these are more open-ended. The developer, or provider, of the add-in, deploys a web application external to SharePoint and thus, can use any web development techniques at their disposal.

### Q13: When do we use CSOM and when do we use Server side object model in SharePoint?
Both CSOM and Server side Object Model has advantages and disadvantages and this will depend on your project requirement.

Server Side Object Model: When you write the code in C#.NET or VB.NET, which will be executing at server side and required deployment on Server where SharePoint installed. It takes multiple steps deploy and you have to deploy as a solution.

CSOM : CSOM you do not need to deploy the code on the Server. It can be used in any Desktop or Web Client. You don’t need to do the safe control entry, no GAC deployments and No need of restaring IIS and No overload on server. Much Faster than Server side object model.

Csom is used when we can deal with lists , libraries and other objects where data can be fetched from client side. Whereas, server side is uded mainly for timer jobs,dealing with central admin , visual webparts and application pages, where client side dlls wont serve purpose.

### Q14: What is the Difference between Master Pages and Layout Pages in SharePoint?
Master Page: The main template where all the common/shareable things like html controls( for footer, header and navigation),CSS, JS files.
We could have only one master page for each sharepoint site.

Page Layout: Basically it contains the HTML controls,CSS and JS files which are only specific for creating look and feel for specific pages, and it inherits look and feel from master page.
We can have multiple page layouts for site.

### Q15: How to set item level permission permission in a list?
The item level permission can be set by multiple ways. Such as: 
1. By opening list and sharing item to any user manually using GUI. 
2. Programmatically using CSOM, SSOM, REST API. 
3. We can also develop a custom SharePoint Designer workflow to set the permission on the SharePoint List items.

### Q16: What is User Information List and when does user get added to the sharepoint site?
he User Information List (“/_catalogs/users/simple.aspx” or “_catalogs/users/detail.aspx”) is a hidden list in each site collection that is only visible and accessible to Site Collection Administrators. The User Information List stores metadata information about a user. Some metadata examples are Display Name (name), Login Name (samAccountName), Department, Picture, Email, SID (determines authorization rights), etc.

User gets added to the user information list if the when the users are explicitly added to the sharepoint site or when the users access the site.

### Q17: Difference between Timer Job and Windows Task Scheduler?
**Timer Jobs**
1. Timer jobs require downtime to deploy.
2. Control via Central Admin.
3. Schedule of Timer Job will be backed up and restore in your normal process of SharePoint backup and restore.
4. Can be deployed using standard WSP solution.
5. Custom Timer Jobs provides the power to specify Job LockTypes (i.e. SPJobLockTypes) which guarantees that multiple instances of same 6. job will never execute at the same point in time.
**Windows Task Scheduler**
1. Windows Scheduled task doesn't require downtime to install/update.
2. The task will only run on the server that you've installed it on.
3. Administrator needs to manually manage backup and restore of Schedule Tasks
4. No standard built in deployment method
5. No multiple instance guarantee. Administrator needs to make sure that no two instances are running at the same time.
Ref: https://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/questions/96089/when-should-we-use-sharepoint-timer-job-and-when-windows-task-scheduler
### Q19. What is SPSite and SPWeb?
The SPSite object represents a collection of sites, i.e. Site Collection, a top level site and all its sub sites. - It is used to get a sub site of a Site Collection. - It is represented within an SPSiteCollection object that consists of the collection of all site collections in the Web application. - It contains the various subsites and the information regarding them. SPWeb: - The SPWeb object represents an instance of a SharePoint Web, and the SPWeb object contains things like the actual content. - It represents a SharePoint Foundation website. - SPWeb object automatically adds the new SPWeb object to an internal list. - It contains things like the actual content.

### Q20. Difference between list and library in SharePoint?
List: When you create any type of web content in SharePoint Online it is called List. For an example it can be calendar, task list, contact list or any kind of data with columns and rows which you create depending on your needs or you can use predefined templates.

Share Point Library?
A library in SharePoint is essentially a special list, explicitly created to store documents. That’s all it is. It is a special web part that already exists in SharePoint (called Document Library) that allows storing documents and has all the functionality around documents (document preview, versioning, check-in/check-out, document approval, file type breakdown, etc.)

**Lists:**
*Can have attachments
*Have major versions only
*Do not have Check-in/Check-out features

**Libraries:**
*Cannot have attachments (files are directly in the library)
*Have both minor (draft) and major (published) versioning
*Have Check-in/Check-Out
*Publishing Libraries can use Page Layouts
*Have Unique Document Ids out of the box

### Q21: How to prevent users from accessing old versions of a document?
OPTION 1: DISABLE VERSIONING ALTOGETHER
Option 2: CREATE A CUSTOM PERMISSIONS LEVEL
Ref: https://sharepointmaven.com/how-to-prevent-users-from-accessing-old-versions-of-a-document/

### Q22: What is Microsoft flow?
t allows you to automate business processes by building workflows based on certain triggers and actions. For example, once a new entry is added to the SharePoint list – an email can be sent asking an individual to review. 

What makes the Microsoft Flow unique is that your workflow can interact with other applications like MailChimp, DropBox, Twitter, SharePoint, and OneDrive.

### Q23: How to stop site and file sharing in SharePoint and OneDrive?

### Q25: Create a custom list in sharepoint
https://sharepointmaven.com/create-custom-list-sharepoint/

### Q26: What is power App?
PowerApps is a software to build custom business applications without the knowledge of app development or custom coding.

How power apps related to share point?
PowerApps is independent of SharePoint, however, is tightly integrated with it, being part of the Office 365 suite. While PowerApps is designed to work with a number of different sources, like external databases, you can also easily connect PowerApps to any SharePoint list, library or OneDrive, which allows you to store and retrieve information without a need to know databases or SQL. You can also connect to many other data sources (Twitter, Box, etc.)

PowerApps potentially will alleviate the need to hire expensive custom developers, giving you the power and tools necessary to move your business forward.

### Q27: Where can we run power apps?
On the Web via Microsoft Dynamics 365
On the mobile device via Windows Mobile, iOS or Android
From the SharePoint List or Library view

Earlier, you acheive this using sharepoint designer.

### Q28: What are the major components of Power Apps?
**Gallery**
A gallery is a way of visualizing the data in the app. It is a template that allows you to see and navigate data.for example, you might have a gallery that contains a screen to see all the reconrds, then a screen to view the given record and a screen to edit a record.

**Screen**
A screen is a way to visualize a particular dataset or record on a screen (a mobile, ipad, desktop). you typically have one to view all records, one to view particular recond, once to edit. Once again, when you create an app from the template, you have screens already pre-built for you (they are part of a gallery you choose above). But you can add additional screens if necessary.
**Card**
A screen consistes of cards. A card is an area on the screen that shows a given record from your SharePoint list or any other database you used to build an app.  For example, if you had a SharePoint list storing project names and built a PowerApp from this list, a single card might contain a Project Name field or Project Manager field or Project Type field or a Status field.

A card would contain all various attributes (called Controls in PowerApp) related to the display of the record. 

**Control**
Controls is what allows you to visualize and interact with your records. Depending on the type of your field, you can have different types of controls.

**Property**
Each control has properties. For example, a text entry box has a property for font size, text color, text box fill color and so on. Properties can be accessed and changed from the Properties drop-down on the left-hand-side of the screen as well as on the panel on the right-hand-side once the property is selected.

**Function**
Functions is how you interact with and change the properties. If you are familiar with Excel, you are in luck as the syntax for PowerApps functions is kind of similar to Excel.

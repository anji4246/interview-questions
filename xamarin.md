## My Favourite Xamarin Interview Questions

### Q1: What is Xamarin?
Ans:
Xamarin is an open source app platform from Microsoft for building modern & performant iOS and Android apps with C# and .NET. Xamarin runs in a managed environment that provides conveniences such as memory allocation and garbage collection. 

Xamarin enables developers to share an average of 90% of their application across platforms. This pattern allows developers to write all of their business logic in a single language (or reuse existing application code) but achieve native performance, look, and feel on each platform.

### Q2: Who Xamarin is for
Xamarin is for developers with the following goals:

Share code, test and business logic across platforms.
Write cross-platform applications in C# with Visual Studio.

### Q3: What is the advantage of Xamarin Development?
Ans:
#### Advantages:
One of the best parts of Xamarin is that it contains about 90% of the reusable code and it can be also recycled for the development of the apps on the various platforms.
In Xamarin, it is possible to access each and every native API. For these reasons only it is possible to completely use the Native UI, Bluetooth and SDKs.
Maintainance and the updating of the apps that are build using the Xamarin require less work.
With the help of the Xamarin, a developer can create apps for mobile and desktop experiences simultaneously.
Xamarin takes the advantages of the native framework and usually, it takes 1 to 3 days for the iOS and the Android platform to catch up on the latest features.

#### Disadvantages:
Ans:
Slightly delayed support for the latest platform update
Limited access to the open sources libraries
There are a few problems with the Xamarin Ecosystem
One will require basic knowledge of the native language
Not suitable for the apps that are of heavy graphics
Larger app size
Compatibility issues with the third party libraries and the tools

### Q4: What are the development approaches in Xamarin?
Ans:
Xamarin has two approaches for app development. These are

Xamarin.Forms: 
Xamarin.Forms is a framework which is used to build the user interface in the mobile application.

Forms are the choices for the developers who want to create one application for all the separate mobile platforms, which are Windows, iOS, and Android. Xamarin.Forms allows the developer to create just one UI which can be used across all platforms like Android, iOS, and Windows.

Xamarin Native: This approach is used in those scenarios when we want to create a separate version of the same App for different platforms. Developers can use Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.Windows libraries to create the applications for each particular platform.

### Q5: What is XAML and what are the advantages of XAML?
Ans:
XAML stands for the Extensible Application Markup Language. XAML allows you to define the user interface in Xamarin. Forms application use the markup language rather than code. i.e. In xamarin, you use XAML to define the UI and .NET code to define the business logic.

Advantages:
XAML gives a clean division between an application and its code. Thus, it enables a clear developer-designer workflow.
XAML has the parent-child hierarchy of user-interface objects with greater visual simplicity.

### Q6: What are the different kinds of pages are present in the Xamarin.forms?
The following are some of the different pages that are available in the Xamarin.forms:

##### Content page – this type of the page displays a single view, often a container such as a stack layout or the scroll view.
##### Master-Detail page – this type of page manages two types of panes of information.
##### Navigation page – a page that manages the navigation and the user experiences as a stack of other pages
##### Tabbed page – this page allows the navigation of the children pages using the tab.
##### Templated page – a page that helps to display the full page content with a control template and the base class for the content page.
##### Carousel page – a page allowing the swipe gestures between the subpages such as a gallery.

### Q7: Whatis databinding and what are the different types of binding modes available in Xamarin?
Ans:
Data binding is the technique of linking properties of two objects so that changes in one property are automatically reflected in the other property. i.e. In xamarin, using Data binding you can establish a connection between the Application user interface and an Application logic.

The following are the different types of data binding modes in Xamarin:

Default
One way – changes in the source affects the target
One way to the source – changes in the target affect the source
Two way – changes in the source and target affect each other

### Q8: What is Xamarin Profiler?
Ans:
Xamarin Profiler is a tool which is used by the developers to keep an eye on the information about the particular App inside the Visual Studio. With the help of Xamarin Profiler, developers can easily analyze the App's behavior. We can use the profiler to track the application's memory information and can sample its statistics.

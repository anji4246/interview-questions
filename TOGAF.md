### What is an enterprise? What is enterprise architecture?
TOGAF defines ‘‘enter prise’’ as any collection of organizations that has a common set of goals.

The term ‘‘enter prise’’ in the context of ‘‘enter prise architecture’’ can be used to denote both an entire enterprise — encompassing all of its information and technology services, processes, and
infrastructure — and a specific domain within the enterprise. In both cases, the architecture crosses multiple systems, and multiple functional groups within the enterprise.

The business operating model concept is useful to determine the nature and scope of the enter prise architecture within an organization. 

 For example,acommon framework can provide a basis for the development of an Architecture Repository for the integration and re-use of models, designs, and baseline data.
 
### Why do I need an enterprise architecture?
The purpose of enterprise architecture is to optimize across the enterprise the often fragmented legacy of processes (both manual and automated) into an integrated environment that is
responsive to change and supportive of the deliver y of the business strategy.

An enterprise architecture provides you the competitive advantage, by providing a strategic context for the evolution of the IT system in response to the constantly changing needs of the business
environment.

A good enterprise architecture enables you to achieve the right balance between IT efficiency and business innovation.

It allows individual business units to innovate safely in their pursuit of competitive advantage. At the same time, it ensures the needs of the organization for an integrated IT strategy are met, permitting the closest possible synergy across the extended
enterprise. 

The advantages that result from a good enterprise architecture bring important business benefits, which are clearly visible in the net profit or loss of a company or organization:

A more efficient IT operation:
* Lower software development, support, and maintenance costs
* Increased portability of applications
* Improved interoperability and easier system and network management
* Improved ability to address critical enterprise-wide issues like security
* Easier upgrade and exchange of system components

Better return on existing investment, reduced risk for future investment:
* Reduced complexity in IT infrastructure
* Maximum return on investment in existing IT infrastructure
* The flexibility to make, buy, or out-source IT solutions
* Reduced risk overall in new investment, and the costs of IT ownership

Faster, simpler, and cheaper procurement:
* Buying decisions are simpler, because the infor mation governing procurement is readily available in a coherent plan
* The procurement process is faster — maximizing procurement speed and flexibility without sacrificing architectural coherence
* The ability to procure heterogeneous, multi-vendor open systems

### What is an architecture framework?
An architecture framework is a foundational structure, or set of structures, which can be used for developing a broad range of different architectures. 
It should describe a method for designing a target state of the enterprise in terms of a set of building blocks, and for showing how the building blocks fit together. 
It should contain a set of tools and provide a common vocabulary.  It should also include a list of recommended standards and compliant products that can be used to implement the building blocks.

### Why do I need TOGAF as a framework for enterprise architecture?
TOGAF has been developed through the collaborative efforts of 300 Architecture Forum member companies from some of the world’s leading IT customers and vendors and represents best
practice in architecture development. Using TOGAF as the architecture framework will allow architectures to be developed that are consistent, reflect the needs of stakeholders, employ best
practice, and give due consideration both to current requirements and to the likely future needs of the business.

Architecture design is a technically complex process, and the design of heterogeneous, multivendor architectures is particularly complex. TOGAF plays an important role in helping to ‘‘demystify’’ and de-risk the architecture development process. TOGAF provides a platform for
adding value, and enables users to build genuinely open systems-based solutions to address their business issues and needs.

### Who would benefit from using TOGAF?
Any organization undertaking, or planning to undertake, the design and implementation of an enterprise architecture for the support of mission-critical business applications will benefit from use of TOGAF.

Organizations seeking Boundaryless Infor mation Flow can use TOGAF to define and implement the structures and processes to enable access to integrated infor mation within and between enterprises.

Organizations that design and implement enterprise architectures using TOGAF are assured of a design and a procurement specification that can facilitate an open systems implementation, thus enabling the benefits of open systems with reduced risk.

### What is TOGAF?
TOGAF is an architecture framework — The Open Group Architecture Framework. TOGAF provides the methods and tools for assisting in the acceptance, production, use, and maintenance of an enterprise architecture. It is based on an iterative process model supported by best practices and a re-usable set of existing architecture assets.

### What is Architecture in the Context of TOGAF?

A formal description of a system, or a detailed plan of the system at component level to guide its implementation.
The structure of components, their inter-relationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time

### What Kind of Architecture Does TOGAF Deal With?
There are four architecture domains that are commonly accepted as subsets of an overall enter prise architecture, all of which TOGAF is designed to support:

* Business Architecture - defines the business strategy, governance, organization, and key business processes
* Data Architecture -  structure of an organization’s logical and physical data assets and data management resources
* Application Architecture - provides a blueprint for the individual application systems to be deployed, their interactions, and their relationships to the core business processes of the organization
* Technology Architecture - descr ibes the logical software and hardware capabilities that are required to support the deployment of business, data, and application services.
This includes IT infrastr ucture, middleware, networ ks, communications, processing, standards, etc.

### Architecture Development Method (ADM)
The TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM) provides a tested and repeatable process for developing architectures. The ADM includes establishing an architecture framework, developing architecture content, transitioning, and governing the realization of architectures.

Phases within the ADM are as follows:
The Preliminary Phase describes the preparation and initiation activities required to prepare to meet the business directive for a new enterprise architecture, including the definition of an Organization-Specific Architecture framework and the definition of principles.

* **Phase A: Architecture Vision:** describes the initial phase of an architecture development cycle. It includes infor mation about defining the scope, identifying the stakeholders, creating the Architecture Vision, and obtaining approvals.
* **Phase B: : Business Architecture** describes the development of a Business Architecture to support an agreed Architecture Vision.
* **Phase C: Information Systems Architectures:** describes the development of Information Systems Architectures for an architecture project, including the development of Data and Application Architectures.
* **Phase D: Technology Architecture:** describes the development of the Technology Architecture for an architecture project.
* **Phase E: Opportunities & Solutions:** conducts initial implementation planning and the identification of delivery vehicles for the architecture defined in the previous phases.
* **Phase F: Migration Planning:** addresses the for mulation of a set of detailed sequence of transition architectures with a supporting Implementation and Migration Plan.
* **Phase G: Implementation Governance:** provides an architectural oversight of the implementation.
* **Phase H:  Architecture Change Management:** establishes procedures for managing change to the new architecture.
* **Requirements Management:** examines the process of managing architecture requirements throughout the ADM.
